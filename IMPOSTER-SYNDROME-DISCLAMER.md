## Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer

Imposter syndrome disclaimer: **I want your help. No really, I do.**

There might be a little voice inside that tells you you're not ready; that you need to do one more tutorial, or learn another framework, or write a few more blog posts before you can help me with this project.

I assure you, that's not the case.

This project has some clear Contribution Guidelines and expectations that you can [read here](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The contribution guidelines outline the process that you'll need to follow to get a patch merged. By making expectations and process explicit, I hope it will make it easier for you to contribute. If not, just join [this Slack chat](https://tempy-dev.slack.com) and AMA!

And you don't just have to write code. You can help out by writing documentation (really needed!!), tests, or even by giving feedback about this work. (And yes, that includes giving feedback about the contribution guidelines.)

Thank you for contributing!
